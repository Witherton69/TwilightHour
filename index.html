            <h2>Why is Twilight so bad? And why are you dedication an entire website to it if you hate it?</h2>
            <p>Twilight was written by a horny middle aged mormon in the early 2000's who named half the characters after her silblings. Including one of the boys her self insert is in a love triangle with. And that is not even the worst of it.
            </p>
            <p>If you came into this thinking this series was worth anything you are sadly mistaken.</p>
            <p>If you can manege to look past her racisim, mysogonie, power play dymanic, and pedophilia throughout the book series, and try and read the books, you will find more plot holes then actual plot and story.</p> <p>The only fun thing about these books is playing "Guess which mormon colonizer this character is based off of!"</p>
            <p>And the reason I am writing this is because I hate people being happy, especially myself.</p>

            <p> Twilight is where we  start this god forsakin journey. Buckle up buckaroo. This movie reshaped how I thought as a child and honestly I think that is were I went wrong. The movie is exstreamly dry compaired to the book and is highly lacking of any actual romantic feeling or moments. The o n l y redeaming thing the movie has is the acting is so genuinly spot on to the characters. </p>

            <p>This is where everything goes wrong. First off, what sorry piece of crap promises to never abandoed thier partner and never lie to them, then after almost getting them killed, you turn around and do exactly that in the same breath. Then has the nerve to be upset when she dosen't take it well and then to avoid responcability, tries to off themself via public exicution. Like. Come on.Bsff.</p>

            <p> This is just a poor exscue for a fight scene and to bring up irrelevant trauma. Not only was the racism completly unnessecery, but the fact you had to go head and appopriate native american cultures and stories to give your white woman protag a "Heroic" moment is literly so low. Like. Grow up and get a hobby that isn't disgusting???? But like. There was some moments in that fight scene that had me locked.</p>

            <p>This is what entering hell feels like both mentally and emotinally. Everything about this movie makes me want to throw myself off a cliff in second hand embaressment.

            <p>Another sorry excuse for a fight scene and irrelevant trauma. There was absolutly no reason for the vampire hierarchy to act like this new vampier hybred was gonna destroy the earth bf. No one in their right minds would have went about this like any of them. This movie genuinly made me want to slam my head into a wall. Though I will not lie I sobbed when the fighting started cause they did my boys so dirty.</p>

            <p> Ok I will bne honest. This was the onbly book I was able to convince myself to fully read. I love it much more then the movies. It inclused alot more moments between Bella and Edward. It actually sounds like a romance novel. This series is finally doing something right. Though Edward is still a dry log and I hate him whole heartedly. </p>

            <p>The depression scene is much more gut wrenchiung in the book. I enjoy they way they actually go into detail about Bella's mental state after Edward pussied out and left her cause telling her teh truth was just so hard for him. We also got to actually see the relatioship between Bella and Jakob flourish.</p>

            <p> The fight scene felt much more cool in my head. Prefered version of it. But also. The amount of unfiltered and raw rage this book makes me feel is unmatched. Stephian literly took her racism to the next step with this one boys. Like genuilny flabbergasted. It's so bad. I hate it here. </p>

            <p>This is what entering hell feels like both mentally and emotinally. I really don't need to change this. It's uncomfterbale and I hate it. Though reading a mormons description of temptation into and the act of adult fun time it highly entertaining. ANd in terms of the fighting and all that. It's. Very anti-clamantic here. She must have lost her sparke or somehting cause the fighting just seemed way too much. Idk. I just don't think she cared all that much after all was said and done. The only nice part in this book is the side romanice between a "Succubi" Vampier from alaska and a vampier from the revolusinary war.</p>

            <p>And for my feelings overall. I am just highly dissapointed. This could have been such a good book idea if it wasn't written by her. There was so much potential with this series that we will never get to see outside of tumbler post and ao3 fanfiction. It's a pity. Truly.</p>
